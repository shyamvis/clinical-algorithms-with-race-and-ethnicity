# Clinical Algorithms with Race and Ethnicity

Clinical algorithms include diagnostic calculators that assess the current presence of a disease or condition, prognostic algorithms that predict the future risk of a disease or health outcome, treatment guidelines for managing chronic conditions, interpretation recommendations for laboratory test results, and precision directions for medication use. This database catalogs risk calculators that use race and ethnicity as predictors, laboratory test results with reference ranges that differ based on race and ethnicity, therapy recommendations based on race and ethnicity, medications with race- and ethnicity-based initiation and monitoring guidelines, and medical devices with differential racial and ethnic performances.
